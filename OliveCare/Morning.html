  <h2>Reminders</h2>
  <h3>Please Leave All Doors Open (except the front hall closet)</h3>
  <p>- Feel free to leave the bathroom fan on if it’s stinky. We’ve installed automatic air fresheners to try to help
    this while we’re away. We also have a room spray located on the living room side table, and air fresheners in the
    cabinets above the half bath toilet.</p>
  <p>- Please leave out the empty box. Olive likes to lie inside of it.</p>
  <p>- Please leave all doors open except the front hall closet. This includes the office, half bath, bedroom, bedroom
    closet, and primary bathroom doors. </p>
  <p>- Toys are located in the bin next to the fire place.</p>
  <p>- Laser pointers are located xx. We have two, in case one gives an issue. Charger is located in the same location
    in case they are dying.</p>
  <p>- Extra wet food and dry food are located in the half bath above the toilet. Dry food is in containers. Even more
    dry food is located in the dining room, below the thermostat, behind the brown bin.</p>
  <p>- Extra treats are located in the bins above the half bath toilet.</p>
  <p>- She likes to sleep under the bed. If you don’t see her when you come in, give it a few minutes and she will come
    out.</p>
  <p>- She’s very happy to see you! She loves people and she definitely gets lonely when we’re gone. We really
    appreciate you guys!!</p>
  <p>- Our apartment will probably be sort of gross because we won’t be there cleaning.</p>
  <p>- She sometimes pees in the bathtub.</p>
  <p>- She is not supposed to scratch the couch. She can scratch the chair.</p>
  <p>- If you take any pics of her, we’d love to see them! We’re going to miss her a lot. </p>
